# 🚢Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features like age, sex, ticket class, and more. It’s built using the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

The goal is to explore the data, clean it, visualize patterns, and train a classification model to make survival predictions.
